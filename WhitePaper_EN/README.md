# ⅠExecution summary
Bitcoin is a global current Internet Crypto token and Blockchain value system, founded by Satoshi Nakamoto based on peer-to-peer networks, with consensus initiative open source software.

《Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System》1 was published by Satoshi Nakamoto, the planner behind Bitcoin, discussing the protocol of Bitcoin on November 1st, 2008. 

Satoshi Nakamoto produced the first block of Bitcoin world-the Genesis block, at 02:15:05 on January 4th, 2009 (Beijing time).

The birth of Bitcoin is extremely valuable and significant, it solves the trust problem among people through cryptography, which makes us realize the value transmission from the simple Internet information transmission to the Blockchain technology.

Blockchain technology was born with Bitcoin, while Bitcoin is the most successful and mature example of industrialization of Blockchain technology.

Blockchain is called as the Value Internet, is an intelligent peer-to-peer network by distributed database to identify, disseminate and record information. The Blockchain technology is based on the decentralized peer-to-peer network, and the open source software combines the cryptography principle, the time series data and the consensus mechanism to ensure the continuity and persistence of the nodes in the distributed database so that the information can be verified immediately, traced back but difficult to tamper and not be shielded, thus creating a set of private, high efficient and secure sharing value system.

The huge potential of the Blockchain technology attracts the world's continuous attentions, the Blockchain technology is now considered as the most potential core technology to trigger the fifth round of subversive revolutionary wave following the steam engine, electricity, information, and Internet technology. The Blockchain technology report submitted by McKinsey predicted that Blockchain technology will achieve scale commercial deployment in 2021.

Chinese government also has high hopes for the Blockchain technology, and the State Council wrote Blockchain into the "thirteen five" for national information planning, which mentioned the "keyword" of Blockchain twice and emphasized the importance of Blockchain technology as the emerging technology.

## 1.1 Current market
The vigorous development of Blockchain technology has led to an increasing number of people recognizing the value of Crypto digital assets. Especially the Ethereum born in 2015 - Turing's complete Blockchain and intelligent contract platform, brought more possibilities into Blockchain. Its design was very flexible, and easy to create applications on it. The virtual machine designed by the Ethereum brought the innovation of the Smart contract, and the excellent developers can easily develop projects and create the corresponding intelligent tokens on the Ethereum at the same time.

The existence of these tokens makes developers flexible to establish a complete ecological system, and taking these tokens as an effective tool to manage platforms. Whether paying the dividends to investors, encouraging them to participate in community building, or guaranting the reality and effectivity of the voting content inside the platform, ect, the tokens have played an unparalleled role. However, there is a need to mention the role of these tokens in the Blockchain world, that is, to obtain funds of early development and project operation for projects as a fundraising chip, which is known as ICO (Initial Coin Offering).

Bying issuing its own Crypto tokens of the project on the Blockchain, which can redeem the project benefits, use on the project platform or to correspond to other values. The project starts ICO, and the investors use the Crypto digital tokens (usually as BTC or ETH) designated by the item side to redeem Crypto tokens of this project.

ICO usually has limits on time or the maximum amount. The value and quantity of the token issued can be static or calculated based on the amount by crowdsale. The participants will receive the corresponding project tokens after crowdsale. In terms of how to profit from the project tokens? When the project tokens exchange in the secondary market - Crypto digital tokens trading platform, ICO participants can then sell their own tokens there.

The “best of both worlds” way is that Blockchain start-up companies can quickly get funds to avoid some of the previous difficult problems, as well as get seed users through this way. For the common users, ICO is a totally new way of investment with the income’s declining of traditional investment target, while in the Blockchain world ICO is an investment way with very low threshold in which everyone can participate. People investing in potential valuable projects can not only get high returns, but also deeply participate in the future development of the project.

We can expect that with the rapid development of Blockchain technology and  the continuous redhot of ICO, there will be more and more Blockchain start-ups and projects born, they will use ICO way to start the funds, also produce more new tokens.

In 2009, we almost only mentioned Bitcoin, but nowadays only Coinmarketcap contains 728 kinds of Crypto digital tokens, such as Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Gnosis, and will show more in the future.

![图](http://118.190.78.127/p2.png "图")

The current market capitalization of the Crypto digital tokens on May 27th, 2017 is $88 billion, 809%2 higher than in 2014 (after the price crash), which is expected to reach $200 billion in two years. While the percentages of Bitcoin in total market capitalization fell to 48.3% (95% from 2013) and is expected to fall to 30% in two years. 

Bitcoin and most other Altcoins have hit a record high recently, while ICO market is showing a hot scene at the same time.

Some of recent ICO projects:

A、First Blood - 5.5 million dollars in 15 minutes 

B、SingularityDTV - 7.5 million dollars in 15 minutes

C、Golem - 8.5 million dollars in 15 minutes

D、Melonport - 2.5 million dollars in 5 minutes

E、Cosmos - 17 million dollars in 30 minutes

F、Gnosis - 12.5 million dollars in 10 minutes

It is foreseeable that there will be more ICO projects and new tokens emerged in the future, and this is just the beginning.

## 1.2 Overview
Firstly, ICO project is growing and will continue to grow at a high speed in the future, more and more crypto tokens will also emerge. New investors from the traditional industries will join the feast with their funds to trade crypto tokens and participate in the ICOs.

But there are 2 problems faced by us:

A. Foreign exchange platforms are not friendly to Chinese users. No matter of Poloniex, Kraken or Bittrex, these exchange platforms have various kinds of coins, but the user experience barriers caused by the cultural diversity, language, deposit & fund factors are still blocking the entrance for Chinese users.

B. The domestic exchange platforms are jagged, which brings about a huge market, there are a number of ICO projects at the same time. However, it is nearly hard to imagine that none of the domestic exchange platforms immediately came online toward these tokens of ICO projects.

The trading volume of BTC from Chinese users has once occupied 98% of the whole volume, there are many domestic Blockchain participants who are interested in ICO and actively involved in it, although they obtain tokens by this way, they can only trade these newborn tokens generated from ICO on outer net, we think that this is extremely unreasonable.

## 1.3 Our vision and core goal
Vision: To create a global win-win Blockchain exchange platform

Core goal: ICOcoin is an exchange platform created by Linke Yang and his Bitcoin 

chinese early founding team, which focuses on the Blockchain assets.

- 1、The reliability of all information provided in this document;
- 2、Thereby any error, inadvertent or inaccurate information;
- 3、Or any resulting behavior. 

### ICOCOIN Token or ICOCOIN, is an encrypted token of ICOCOIN

When these words are writted, (i) ICO coin cannot be used for purchasing any goods or serive (ii) ICO coin does not have much pratical use in ICOCOIN.

### ICO coin is not a kind of investment

We do not guarantee, and indeed have no reason to believe that the value of ICO coin will increase. It is possible that ICO Coin will depreciate in some circumstance.Those people, who do not use their ICO coin properly, will probably lose the right of using ICO and lose their ICO coin as well.

### ICO coin is not a kind of owership or control right

Controling ICO does not represent the ownership of ICOCOIN or ICOCOIN applications. ICO does not grant any individual involvement, control, or any right to ICOCOIN and ICOCOIN application decisions.

## 7.2 Risk Statement

### 7.2.1 The risk of losing ICO coin caused by the loss of certificate

ICO coin is likely to be associated with an ICOCOIN account before assigning it to the purchaser. The only way to enter the ICOCOIN account is using the relevant login credentials selected by the buyer, and the loss of these documents will result in the loss of the ICO currency. The best way to securely store login credentials is to store them separately into one or more places for safe, and it is best not to keep and expose them at work.

### 7.2.2 The risk of relevane to Ethereum core protocal 

ICO and ICOCOIN applications are developed based on the Ethereum Protocol, so any failures, unpredictable functional problems, or attacks that occur in the Ethernet protocol are likely to cause ICO or ICOCOIN applications to stop working or malfunction in an unpredictable manner. Moreover, the value of the accounts in Etherneum protocal may go down or up as the same or other way as ICO coin do. More information for other Ethereum protocal, please visit http://www.ethereum.org.

### 7.2.3 The risk of purchasing relevant credentials

Any third party obtains the purchaser’s login or private key, then it is possible to directly control the buyer’s ICO coin. To minimize this risk, the purchaser must protect his or her electronic device against unauthenticated access requests and access to the device content.

### 7.2.4 The risk from the relevance to the judical supervision

Blockchain technology has become the main regulatory target in all major countries of the world. ICOCOIN applications or ICO coins may be affected if regulatory entities intervene or exert influence, such as restrictions on the use of laws and sales for token, which will obstruct or even directly terminate the development of ICOCOIN applications.

### 7.2.5 The risk of ICOCOIN application lacking attention

There is a possibility that ICOCOIN application are not used by a large number of individuals and orginizations, which means that the public does not have enough interest to develop these related distributed applications, and such a phenomenon with lack of interest may have a negative impact on ICO and ICOCOIN applications.

### 7.2.6 The risk of that ICOCOIN related applications or products do not meet ICOCOIN

itself or the purchaser's expectations

The ICOCOIN application is currently in the development stage, and there may be subject to significant changes prior to the release of the official version. Any ICOCOIN itself or purchaser's expectations or imagination of the ICOCOIN application or ICO coin function or form (including the behavior of the participant) may not be met, and any wrong analysis, a design change, etc. may lead to the occurrence of this situation.

### 7.2.7 The risk from hack or steal

Hackers, other organizations or countries have the potential to attempt to interrupt ICOCOIN applications or ICO coins in any way, including service attacks, Sybil attacks, avatars, malware attacks, or conformance attacks, etc.

### 7.2.8 Vulnerability risk and the risk of Cryptography developing by leaps and bounds

With the rapid development of cryptography and the development of science and technology, such as the quantum computers development, it brings the risk of password cracking to the encryption token and ICOCOIN platform, which may lead to the loss of ICO coins.

### 7.2.9 The risk from the attack to ICO coin mining

Like the other central cryptographic tokens, block chains for ICOCOIN applications are also susceptible to mining attacks, such as double-spending attacks, high- computational power attacks, "self-interest" mining attacks, overly competitive attacks, and any successful attack on ICOCOIN applications and ICO coin is a risk, although ICOCOIN team try hard to improve the security of the system, but the above-mentioned mining attack risks exist in reality.

### 7.2.10 The risk from the lack of maintenance or use

ICO coins should not be treated as an investment, although ICO coins may have some value after a certain amount of time, but if ICOCOIN lacks maintenance or use, this value may be very small. If this happens, there may be no follow-up or few follow-up on the platform. Obviously, this is very unfavorable to ICO.

### 7.2.11 The risk from its uninsureds

Unlike the accounts in the bank or other financial institution, the accounts stored in the ICOCOIN or Etherurem network are usually not covered by insurance. The loss in any case will not have any open individual organization underwrite for your loss, but FDIC or Private insurers will provide protection for buyers.

### 7.2.12 The risk of ICOCOIN dissolution 

There may be a possibility that ICOCOIN projects may be subject to major blows or disbanded at any time for reasons, including fluctuations in Etheurem own prices, ICOCOIN application development problems, rupture of business relationships and intellectual property claims.

### 7.2.13 The risk of application failure

ICOCOIN platform may not provide normal service due to various reasons failure, and it may lead to the loss of users’ ICO coins at its severe situation.

### 7.2.14 Other risks from those cannot be predicted

Cryptography is a new and untested technology, in addition to the risks mentioned in this white paper, there are also some risks that ICOCOIN team has not yet mentioned or predicted. In addition, other risks may also occur suddenly, or appear in a combination of a number of already mentioned risks.
