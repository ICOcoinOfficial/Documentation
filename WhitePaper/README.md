《Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System》1 was published by Satoshi Nakamoto, the planner behind Bitcoin, discussing the protocol of Bitcoin on November 1st, 2008. 
Satoshi Nakamoto produced the first block of Bitcoin world-the Genesis block, at 02:15:05 on January 4th, 2009 (Beijing time).
The birth of Bitcoin is extremely valuable and significant, it solves the trust problem among people through cryptography, which makes us realize the value transmission from the simple Internet information transmission to the Blockchain technology.
Blockchain technology was born with Bitcoin, while Bitcoin is the most successful and mature example of industrialization of Blockchain technology.
Blockchain is called as the Value Internet, is an intelligent peer-to-peer network by distributed database to identify, disseminate and record information. The Blockchain technology is based on the decentralized peer-to-peer network, and the open source software combines the cryptography principle, the time series data and the consensus mechanism to ensure the continuity and persistence of the nodes in the distributed database so that the information can be verified immediately, traced back but difficult to tamper and not be shielded, thus creating a set of private, high efficient and secure sharing value system.
The huge potential of the Blockchain technology attracts the world's continuous attentions, the Blockchain technology is now considered as the most potential core technology to trigger the fifth round of subversive revolutionary wave following the steam engine, electricity, information, and Internet technology. The Blockchain technology report submitted by McKinsey predicted that Blockchain technology will achieve scale commercial deployment in 2021.
Chinese government also has high hopes for the Blockchain technology, and the State Council wrote Blockchain into the "thirteen five" for national information planning, which mentioned the "keyword" of Blockchain twice and emphasized the importance of Blockchain technology as the emerging technology.
## Current market
The vigorous development of Blockchain technology has led to an increasing number of people recognizing the value of Crypto digital assets. Especially the Ethereum born in 2015 - Turing's complete Blockchain and intelligent contract platform, brought more possibilities into Blockchain. Its design was very flexible, and easy to create applications on it. The virtual machine designed by the Ethereum brought the innovation of the Smart contract, and the excellent developers can easily develop projects and create the corresponding intelligent tokens on the Ethereum at the same time.
The existence of these tokens makes developers flexible to establish a complete ecological system, and taking these tokens as an effective tool to manage platforms. Whether paying the dividends to investors, encouraging them to participate in community building, or guaranting the reality and effectivity of the voting content inside the platform, ect, the tokens have played an unparalleled role. However, there is a need to mention the role of these tokens in the Blockchain world, that is, to obtain funds of early development and project operation for projects as a fundraising chip, which is known as ICO (Initial Coin Offering).
Bying issuing its own Crypto tokens of the project on the Blockchain, which can redeem the project benefits, use on the project platform or to correspond to other values. The project starts ICO, and the investors use the Crypto digital tokens (usually as BTC or ETH) designated by the item side to redeem Crypto tokens of this project.

ICO usually has limits on time or the maximum amount. The value and quantity of the token issued can be static or calculated based on the amount by crowdsale. The participants will receive the corresponding project tokens after crowdsale. In terms of how to profit from the project tokens? When the project tokens exchange in the secondary market - Crypto digital tokens trading platform, ICO participants can then sell their own tokens there.
The “best of both worlds” way is that Blockchain start-up companies can quickly get funds to avoid some of the previous difficult problems, as well as get seed users through this way. For the common users, ICO is a totally new way of investment with the income’s declining of traditional investment target, while in the Blockchain world ICO is an investment way with very low threshold in which everyone can participate. People investing in potential valuable projects can not only get high returns, but also deeply participate in the future development of the project.
We can expect that with the rapid development of Blockchain technology and  the continuous redhot of ICO, there will be more and more Blockchain start-ups and projects born, they will use ICO way to start the funds, also produce more new tokens.
In 2009, we almost only mentioned Bitcoin, but nowadays only Coinmarketcap contains 728 kinds of Crypto digital tokens, such as Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Gnosis, and will show more in the future.
The current market capitalization of the Crypto digital tokens on May 27th, 2017 is $88 billion, 809%2 higher than in 2014 (after the price crash), which is expected to reach $200 billion in two years. While the percentages of Bitcoin in total market capitalization fell to 48.3% (95% from 2013) and is expected to fall to 30% in two years. 
Bitcoin and most other Altcoins have hit a record high recently, while ICO market is showing a hot scene at the same time.
